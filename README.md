# automationChallenge

In the current repository there are three projects with the next funtionalities:



karate: contains test cases about the services exposed in the url https://rickandmortyapi.com. The idea here was
to use Karate to test those services.


mobileAutomation: It contains the automation for the APK called "PreciseUnitConversion". In this project there is
just one test case automated using the design pattern called POM.

mobileAutomationScreenPlay: It contains the automation for the APK called "PreciseUnitConversion". In this project there are
3 test cases for the mobile application using Screenplay pattern design.


restAssuredRickAndMorty: contains test cases about the services exposed in the url https://rickandmortyapi.com. The idea here was
to use RestAssured to test those services using Screenplay pattern design.
 
Notes:

The artefact for the mobile application cannot scroll up or down by itself, so  I do this manually.
